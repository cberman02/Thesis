## Background and Literature
* Declining Public Transportation Usage
* First Mile/Last Mile Problem (FM/LM)
* TNC's Impact on Public Transportation
  * Reduces public transit demand in cities with "high urban compactness" (Lee, et. al 2019)
  * Serves as compliment (net) but masks heterogeneity (Hall, et. al 2018)
  * Serves as compliment to high quality public transit but substitute to low quality transit (Zhao 2019)
  
## Research Question and Methodology

* Can Uber be used to supplement public transportation by offering a solution to the FM/LM problem?
  * Diff-in-diff comparing Buffalo and similar cities
  * Spatial analysis of customers added with introduction of Uber (?)

```


## Data Sources
* National Transit Database (NTD)
  * Contains monthly ridership data from 2002-present for all public transportation agencies that receive federal funding
* Google search data

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width="70%"}
both_rows <- rbind(head(df, n=3), tail(df, n=3))
both_rows %>%
  kable("html", align = "c") %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE, position = "center", font_size = 12)
#print(both_rows[1:5])
```

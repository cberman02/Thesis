## Background
* Declining Public Transportation Usage
* Corresponds with the rise of Transportation Network Companies (TNCs)
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width="70%"}
overall_avg_ridership <- aggregate(ridership ~ date, data = df, FUN = mean)

ggplot(overall_avg_ridership, aes(x = date, y = ridership)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Average Ridership Over Time",
       subtitle = "Across all Transit Agencies",
       x = "Date",
       y = "Ridership",
       color = "Agency") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "red", linetype = "dashed") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::number_format()) +
  scale_color_manual(values = wes_palette) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))  # Optional: Rotate x-axis labels for better visibility
```

## Background
* Public transit companies partner with TNCs
  * Pinellas County subsidies
  * Atlanta, GA MARTA on the Go
```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width = "70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("martaconnect-page-banner2.jpg")
```
  
## Literature
* Erhardt, et al. (2022) claim TNCs are the biggest driver of transit ridership decline using NTD data
* Hall, et al. (2018) find that TNCs are a net compliment to public transit but lots of variation using diff-in-diff
* Zhao (2019) finds that TNCs are a compliment to good transit, substitute to bad using monocentric city model
* Agrawal, et al. (2023) finds that subsidizing TNCs increases ridership substantially using monocentric city model

## Research Question
* What is the effect on ridership for public transportation agencies that partner with TNCs?
  * Subsidies
  * Promotion(?)

## Methodology
* Difference-in-difference
  * Treatment: Public transportation agencies that partner with TNCs
  * Control: Public transportation agencies that do not partner with TNCs
  * Time: Before and after partnership
* Considerations
  * Subsetting the dataset
  * Partnership times. Will there be enough data post treatment?

## Data Sources
* National Transit Database (NTD)
  * Contains monthly ridership data from 2005-2019 for all public transportation agencies that receive federal funding
* American Community Survey (ACS)
  * Contains yearly demographic data for all urbanized areas (+65,000 population)
  * Consider using CPS (monthly)

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width="30%", out.height="60%"}
options(width = 60)
head(df)
```

## Preliminary Results
* Limited to FL
* Diff-in-diff of Pinellas County vs. rest of FL
\tiny
```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width="40%", out.height="60%"}
options(width = 30)
analysis_fl <- read_csv("../data/clean/census_transit_fl.csv")

didreg <- feols(
  fml = ridership ~ pop + white + med_house_income + poverty + treated + time + treated*time,
  vcov = "iid",
  data = analysis_fl
)
didreg_fe <- feols(
  fml = ridership ~ pop + white + med_house_income + poverty + treated + time + treated*time | month,
  vcov = "iid",
  data = analysis_fl
)
etable(
  didreg, didreg_fe, 
  coefstat = "tstat", digits = 3, digits.stats = 3
)
```

## Potential Issues
* Classifying partnerships/finding information (changes over time)
* Ensuring that all agencies are classified as treated or control correctly
